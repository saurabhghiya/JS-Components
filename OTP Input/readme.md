## OTP Component

This component is for taking input of a 4 digit OTP.<br>
Here is how these inputs work:
1. Each of the fields only takes a single-digit number as input.
2. When a number is entered, the focus moves to the next input field.
3. Pressing Backspace or Delete key removes the input of the current field, and the focus moves to the previous field.
